## Participation

Remember, participation in discussion is graded. I hope to see thoughtful discussions of topics that we have covered in class, assigned readings, or insights based on your experiences. You may have done that through participation in relevant Slack channels (like #agile, #dataviz, or etc...) **or** via a "Journal Entry" which you can submit using [this Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc8GuAn1iQoauK39SAC5woXCX7w5h7CXTKZp7c1sFwW9MjqoA/viewform). Possible participation topics include, but are not restricted to:


* [Agile Reading](https://github.com/code4policy/modules/blob/master/agile/06-reading.md)
* GitHub Reflection (after researching a Government Agency's GitHub repo)
* Data Visualization / Discussion with Julia Wolfe (Guest Speaker)
* [Agile Reading 2](https://github.com/code4policy/modules/blob/master/agile/07-reading2.md) / Discussion with David Z.  (Guest Speaker)
* Any other topics of your choice...


Participation points may also be awarded for:

* Asking for help from classmates on Slack
* Helping classmates on Slack



## Project

Information about the final project is all available in the [`finalproject/` module](https://github.com/code4policy/modules/tree/master/finalproject)

At the start of Sprint 2, make sure your team has had the following meetings:

* **[Storytime Meeting](https://github.com/code4policy/modules/blob/master/finalproject/02-storytime.md)**
	*  Deliverables for this meeting: A "Backlog" user story board containing your personas and any user stories that were neither in Sprint 1 nor in Sprint 2.

* **[Sprint Planning Meeting](https://github.com/code4policy/modules/blob/master/finalproject/03-sprint-planning.md)**
	*  Deliverables for this meeting: A "Sprint 2" project board containing TODO, IN PROGRESS, BLOCKED and DONE columns and has only the User Stories for Sprint 2.

* **[Daily Standup Meeting](https://github.com/code4policy/modules/blob/master/finalproject/04-daily-standup.md)**
	*  Deliverables for this meeting: A "Burndown" chart showing how many points your team completed each day. This may be saved anywhere in your repo. Please be sure to mention where it is to me in your final project submission.

At the end of Sprint 2, make sure your team has had the following

* **[Sprint Review Meeting](https://github.com/code4policy/modules/blob/master/finalproject/05-sprint-review.md)** - Usually you would have a sprint review meeting with your stakeholers like we did in class, however, **you don't need to have this meeting**. For Sprint 2 your "sprint review" will be replaced with your final project submission and I will provide comments from the user's perspective along with the grades when I review your project. 
	* Deliverables for this meeting: no meeting, only [Project Submission](https://github.com/code4policy/modules/blob/master/finalproject/project.md#submitting-the-project)

	
* **[Sprint Retrospective](https://github.com/code4policy/modules/blob/master/finalproject/06-sprint-retrospective.md)** - You **DO** need to have a Sprint Review meeting with your team like we had in class after your final project submission. If your group needs extra time for it, just let me know when you plan to submit the retrospective for Sprint 2 and I will keep an eye out for it.
	* Deliverables for this meeting: [Sprint Retrospective Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSePfDHMonIleOPRNHqEz3S4yYAern1CIMedsg9XECOv5trG0A/viewform) for Sprint 2.  



Finally, the following individual reflections are required for **each member** of the team, and must be filled out and submitted **AFTER** you complete your final project:
	
* Deliverables:
	* [Technical Learning Reflection](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSclInjENWwqLMC_SFWgyav1rHfi5ZRB4Unwtjc1mF4SauvsKQ/viewform)
	* [Final Project Reflection](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdxXBqlonzG97PctN8iakot8w4L-YkgOLNji-vJ2HY-qi2mlA/viewform)
